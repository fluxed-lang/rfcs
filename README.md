# Flux RFCs

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a document outlining changes made to Flux and its codebase. 

This repository contains RFCs for the Flux language - these are primarily for my own sanity, since I'm terrible at organisation. In the extraordinarily unlikely event Flux becomes popular, the RFCs in this repository will be used by the community to discuss features being added to Flux.
